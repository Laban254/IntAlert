## Description
This is a project that tries to clean the internet by providing a plartform for the internet users to lauch complains on insigtful content on the internet. The team hopes that the application will help create a more sane internet community.

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**: This is the  database management system that we use to hold our information. This is because it is a popular DBMS and has a wide community.
- **Node.js**: This is a javascript framework that we use to perform the backend functionalities. The reason for this framework is that it is simple to use and contains a large library that we can integrate into the application.
- **Express**: This is a web application framework that is available in npm and contains a wide library that we can use to integrate our front end and the backend together.
- **Angular**: We will use angular as our front end framework.
